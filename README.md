# textRPG


## BASIC INFO
textRPG is a super simple rpg game in console application (even tho the code is not so simple)
First o First this was created as a  challenge for me for a few days to improve my programming skills cause i started learning C# only recently, but after a few days i became fascinated and the project became a much larger scale game to endure and learn new things from all aspects of c# before starting with Unity programming
This project can be discontinued at anytime if loose a motivation to do this and that can be really far away from now or really soon


## FEATURES:
- "Complex" difficulty system that let you swap difficulties anytime without any impact on game
- Featuring 4 enemies (more coming soon)
- money system and simple stat improval with equipment
- Featuring over 5 Equipment types with each of them having around 15-20 pieces which scales based on your progression throughout the game
- Complex shop system to buy all of the equipment
## FUTURE FEATURES
- Complex Leveling system
- More stats types with complex calculations
- More enemy types with much more challenge added to them
- Code Improvements
- New Formula for calculating Enemy Hits and Player/Enemy Defense
- More Equipment Types (rings, necklaces, bracelets and much more)
- Maybe a non-console version in unity but that's so far away from now i should not even talk about it
